            <p>偉大なるドットアートに捧ぐ</p>
            
            <p>Remember, this is a platform for pixel art. Pixel art is great, furiously stimulates imagination, 
                changes even one pixel makes it completely different, and that's another attraction.</p>
            
            <p>The current full graphic image is of course attractive, but there is no room for imagination. I can't empathize.The 
                imagination that complements in the brain works because there is a difference between "screen" and "self".</p>
        
            <p>I want you to experience monsters, mediocre towns, forests, seas and deserts, ridiculous demon cave, brilliant food, 
                the sharpness of the hero's sword, and the expressions I felt as a child.</p>
